NOTES. II. c. xxx. ἓ 6--c. xxxi. ᾖ 3. 209

sed either implies an ellipse, ·th0ugh Servilius had not
fulfilled his promises,’ or is opposed to confirmavit animos,
which may mean ‘increased their confidence in themselves,‘
the edict being so far a confession of weakness on the part
of the Senate. It seems hardly possible that sed et should
mean here what it frequently does, ‘ and not only so, but.’

ἓ 9. defendi...pafi. The change of subJ'eet is noticeable.

ἓ 10. et ipse. That is, he wished to bring the enemy to a
decisive engagement at once, as Vetusius had not done.

ς 11. castra, plural, as frequently. quisque. c. 20. 12.

512. contemptim. Livy is very fond of these adverbs in
im ; besides the ordinary ones he use8, caesim, carptim, cater-
vatim, coniunctim, cursim, manipulatim, payatim, punctim,
summatim.

pffls. In the earliest times, the pilum was confined to the
Triarii, cf. c. 27. 6. The other troops were armed with the
hasta. But by the time of the war with Pyrrhus this had
been reversed, and the two front divisions used the pilum and
the Triarii the hasta. When this began it is impossible to
say, but the change of weapons seems to be intimately con-
nected with the change from the close phalanx to the mani-

pular legion.

ς 13. micare, a sort of zeugma; viderunt is supplied from
sensere.

ς 14. adepti, ‘overtaking.’ Cf. 64. 4.

c. xxxr. ἕ 1. exuitque. Some editors omit the quc. In
either case, fundit fuqatque is to be regarded as one expression
to which exuit is joined by que, or appended asyndeton.

5 2. turbatos. c. 25. 5.

dum...pandunt. Young scholars will notice the ordinary
idiom of the indicative after dum in narrative. Dum here,
as frequently. has not only its temporal sense, but a sort
of causal sense as well. The action and its consequence are
regarded simply as concurrent actions. Roby, Lat. Gr., Sch.

introrsum, ἀο. Cf. xxxix. 17. 8, Conferti, pluribus introrsus
ordinibus acie firmata, where pl. intr. ord. explains conserti.

5 3. super=‘ in addition to,’ ‘ over and above‚’ first found
in Livy in this sense. 1. 50. 6, alii super alios trucidantur,
where the half literal, half metaphorica] sense suggests the

origin of the usage.
