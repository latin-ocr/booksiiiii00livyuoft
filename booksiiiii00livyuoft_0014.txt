That the latter and their friends should have made
attempts to procure their restoration is in the highest
degree probable, and the account of Livy (11. cc. 3—7,
19—20) describing such attempts‚ and indicating a
division os feeling on the subject among the Latin
towns, as well as in Rome itself, may contain a his-

could hardly have believed that the chal-ming exploits
of Scaevola and Olaelia accounted satisfactorily for such

As soon as Rome recovered from the Etruscan
defeat, she became engaged in wars with the neigh-
bouring peoples. Volscians and Aurumans, AEquians,
Sabines, all appear at war with her, the names of her

Rome in connexion with these wars, we mean Rome
as the head of the Latin cities, which shared with her
