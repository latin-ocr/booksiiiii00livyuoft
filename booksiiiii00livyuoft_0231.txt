place, these in their turn fighting in front of their standards
would be antesiynani. The term therefore would not be con-
fined to any one portion of the army, but would be used oi
that portion which for the time being was fighting in the front
of the battle with its standards behind it. That line of stan—
dards behind the front line was the constant clement of the
battle order—so long as it was maintained the battle was not
lost: when the army were gaining, this line was advanced
(signa promovere), when it was broken, the battle was lost.

c. m. ἓ 2. Saturnalia. The first institution of tbe Satur-
nalia, a festival in honour of the old Italian god Saturnus. In
8.c. 217 it was considerably modified by the introduction of Greek
elements, and became later the wild carnival that we find it
under the early empire. It was originally a one day’s festival,
extended by Augustus to three, and by Caligula to five days,
Under the later republio some uncertainty as to the day appears
to have prevailed, owing to the alteration in the number of days
in the months introduced by Julius Caesar, and the popular
celebration straggled over as many as seven days. This was pro-
bably the reason why Augustus fixed the three days for it. The
purely religious part lasted always for one day only.

ἓ 5. Aristodemum. This man, sumamed ὀ μαλακός, had,

and made himself despot about the time of the expulsion of the
Tarquins. He had appeared as the ally and champion of the
Latins against the Etruscans at Aricia, of. c. 14. 6. As Tar-
quinius had to be located somewhere to die, Aristodemus an-
