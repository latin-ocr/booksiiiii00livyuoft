210 NOTES. H. c. xxxl. ἐς 5--11,

§5. extram. Cf. 23. 13.

abiret. A general term for retiring fiom an office, whether
at the expiration of the term of it, or otherwise. Cf. Cic. in
Pisonem 111., abiens magristratu, and comp. 32. 11.

Δ The dictatorship lasted only for six months. The soldiers
accused the consul of wishing to protract the war until
M. Valerius, who was inclined to deal fairly with the plebs,
should be no longer in office and consequently unable to
perform his promises.

forte temere. ‘Trusting to providence.’ The words are
asyndeta. So forte casu, clam furtim. (In nocte silentio and
similar phrases, quoted here by Miiller, the one adverb rather
explains the other.) Asyndeton in one pair of words is most
usual in, if not confined to, cases where the two words are
associated by meaning or usage.

S er12g7ergt‚ ‘to march the army straight up the mountain)
o 1. . .

ἓ 6. ignavia. c. 4. 3.

ad coniectum teli, within range. So ad and sub ictum teli
venire.

§8- actionum. ‘In his very first address to the Senate
pleaded the cause of the victorious people and moved “that
the Senate do consider the case of insolvent debtors.’'’

Actio, as used here, is the substantive of ayo in its use affere
cum aliquo, and means the speech made in support of 8
proposal submitted to any one, especially to the people in
comitia. Equally it is used of the speech of an advocate to a
‘ury. From the use of pro populo, it would seem as if Livy
herc had the forensic sense of the word in his mind as well as
the parliamentary. In the phrase tribuniciae actiones, which
frequently occurs, the word has the same meaning, but a little
wider, and coi-responde very nearly to the modern ‘ agitations,'
that is, meetings held and speeches made in order to elicit
a demonstration of public opinion. Comp. also 111. 20. 1.

The words ea cle re quid fieri placet were the formula by
which the president invited discussion.

§ 9. reiecta, ⁴ shclved.' The expression corresponds to our
parliamentary expression, ‘ to move the previous quest-ion :’
different from the other use noticed, 22. 5.

auctor. c. 1. 4.

ἓ 11. suam, so. plebis, ‘on their account,’ because the
plebs are the virtual subjopt.
