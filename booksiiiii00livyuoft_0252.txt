particle, see on c. 11, and compare the sentence, c. 39. 10,
Acceperunt...rettulerunt. In both cases there is an antithesis
between the two members, the first corresponding to a clause
introduced by a concessive particle; so that que may be trans-
lated by ‘but’ or ‘ only.' ⁴ But they used up all the sui-plus!

ἓ 10. canebant. The regular word of oracular or religione
official response, because such responses were originally given
in verse. Here there is perhaps added the force of ‘ repetition?
as in Gk. ὑμνεῖν.

extis...per aves, c. 24. 6.

ἓ 11. qui...tamen‚ c. 29. 4. The force of tamen here is
that though these terrore had been excited by apprehension
of some general religione faultiness, in the end they were
allayed by the punishment of one individual.

poenas, by being bnried alive.

c. xmn. ἓ 2. populationum, not simply by metonymy for
praedae. For pleni here is evidently intended to convey the
sense, ‘sick or tired of,’ the feeling consequent on constant
repetition of the same thing, like the Gk. μεστός.

ἓ 4. potestaffls, objective genitive after invidia. That

v auxilioque, see last chapter. The situation was this. YVhen
the consuls disregarding the intercession of the tribune
Licinius proceeded to punish those who refused to serve, they
did so on the strength of an assurance from the other tribunes
that, in case Licinius proceeded against them for contempt of
the tribunician authority, they (the other tribunes) would
extend to the consuls the benefit of the auxilii latio, and veto
such proceedings: a similar situation is described, 1v. 53. 7.

ξ 5. et...qu1dem...rabio‚ c. 2. 9.

§6. ipse consul. Explained by odae'o consulis below. He
was the very consul, hatred sor whom made the army inclined
to betray the state. By this arrangement. which is rather
strained, Livy makes the antithesis more effective than if he
had written, Ipse consul cuins odio, dte.

‘He, the unpopular consul, by his unassisted vigour, sus-
tained the fortunes of the state which the army for hatred of
him were willing for their part to betrn.y.'

ξ 7. artes, ‘qualities‚' but implying the improvement by
culture and cducntion ot· special gifts.
