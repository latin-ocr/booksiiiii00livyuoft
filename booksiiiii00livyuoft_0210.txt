introduced into the Senate at this time. The following sen-
tence, id mirum, &c.‚ would seem to imply that the number was
considerable. It is assumed by most historians (Mommsen 1.
266) that the whole number added to the Senate at this time
consisted of plebeianS. But this is improbable in itself (Ihne,
R. H. 1, 136), and is not borne out by Livy’s account. For he
detines conscripti to mean novus Senatus which, unless we are
to suppose that there were no patricians outside the kingly
Senate, might well include patricians as well as plebeians. In
this case, patres in this phrase will mean simply the original
senators.

ἓ 11. traditum ut, ‘ dates (is derived) the custom of surn-
{ncogiitnhgh' Ut depends on the idea of institution implied in

mirum quantum is regarded as a simple adverb, and con-
sequently does not affect the mood of the verb. Exceptional
use in Livy, cf. 1. 16. ὅ, where the verb is in subj. Gk. θαυμα-
σίως ὠς, θαυμάσιον ὅσον.

c. 11. ἓ 1. regem. A curicus instance of the formal
conservatism of the Romans and their tendency to legal fic-
tions. As certain rites had been performed only by a Rex, a
Rex must continue to perform them, but to prevent the possi-
bility of this official becoming rex in anything more than name
he was made incapable of holding office and commonly called
by an apparently derisive title—other forms of the title are
Rex sacrorum, sacrificiowwn and sacrificus.

The Pontifex Maximus would seem to have succeeded to
the King’s position as head of the Roman religious establish-
ment. Seeley, Livy, Bk. 1. p. 96.

ξ 2. nescio an, ‘perhaps‘ An elliptical construction, as an
must introduce the second member of an alternative question.
The writer by leaving out the first member shows that the
second is that to which he inclines as true. Consequently in
classica] prose writers it always introduces a modest affirma-
tion. In post-Augustan writers it is constantly used to ex-
press mere doubt or ignorance. Roby, Lat. Gr. §2255; Mar-
tial, selected epigrams, 11. pref. note.
