quia tm'butim a sinqulis pro portione cemus exiqebatur. Such a
tax is mentioned in connexion with the earliest kings, and
specially in connexion with the Servian reforms, when it was
regulated according to the Servian property qualification.
But the systematic levying of it seems to date from the year
406, when the troops first began to receive pay. From that
time, whenever the ordinary revenues did not cover the military
expensos, this extraordinary tax was levied to supply the defi-
ciency. Sometimes after a successful and sruitful war it was
returned to the citizens. But this was not a rule. It was
levied apparently on real and personal property and ceased

“ after the conquest of Macedonia in 167.

ἓ 2. subnexus, the earliest of the bridges of Rome built to
connect the city with the Janiculus. It was built of wood, and,
in consequence of certain religious feelings connected with it,
was still formed of wood in the first century A. D. It probably
stood a little below the ruins now known as ponte rotto, which
stand on the site of the pons lapideus or Aemilius, built nc.
179—142. This latter probably stood on the site of an older
stone bridge, for Livy speaks of two bridges existing as early as
1³.c. 194.
