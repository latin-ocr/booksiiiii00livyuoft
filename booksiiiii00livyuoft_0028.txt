xxiv INTRODUOTJON. II.

are separated often by a considerable number of words,
111. 16. 4⁴.

Great freedom is used in the position of adver-bs,
which are placed even between substantive and at
tribute3 11. 10. 8. Ferme, non amplius, ete. precede
or follow the words they qualify.

Several conjunctions and particles are used in
unusual positions 3 eg. I quur, first word in a sentence,
Namque and itaque, second, etc.

(8) Poetic rhythm3 Haec ubi dicta dedit (Vir-
gilian), 11. 56, 1 n.

(9) Arrangement by alliteration5 e. g. 11. 12. 7,
Quo temere traaeit fortuna facinus.

(10) Pleonasm3 Nemo unus, Itaque erqo, etc.

II. Under the head of syntax, we have to notice :

(1) Hypallage, e.g. 11. 51. 7.

(2) Variation of gender, number, and person in
the same passage, Ad duodecim millia hostium sunt

caesa, capti quinqenti; ete. 111. 6. 3, urbanos ayt-estem,
65. 115 lmmines...nobis,· cf. 11. 2.

(3) Plural verb after collective nouns in the same
clause. This before Livy's time is rare and confined
to one or two words, the commonest being pars.

(4) The adjective as predicate or as attribute
agrceing in gender with the sense of the substantive,
eg. Capita conjurationis caesi sunt,- Inyens turba

⁴ In Cicero this is confined to the insertion of the sub-
ject between the participle and anxium-5, and that, where the
subject is reserved to the cml of the scntvnm·.
