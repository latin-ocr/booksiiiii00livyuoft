their own value and importance. When once this was
learnt and the commons had made up their minds to
act on the knowledge, the exclusive position of the
patrieians was sapped, and the equalization of the orders
became only a matter of time. How the first step was
taken it is impossible to say for certain. It must have
been by some action on the part of the plebs which ex-
pressed their determination either to be recognised
and protected in the community to which they nomi-

ever could not prohibit the Judge from pronounc'mg his
sentence, the senate from adopting its deci-ce, or the eenturics
from giving their votos.'’ Mommsen, 1. 281.
