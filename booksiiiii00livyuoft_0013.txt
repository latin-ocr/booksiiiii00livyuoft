people forbidden the use of iron', except for agri-
cultural purposes, and it seemed as if Rome were
about to sink permanently into the condition of a
dependency of Etruria. From this it was saved by
the Italian Greeks. Porsinna, owing to the in-
tervention of the Greeks of Oumae, suffered a repulse
under the walls of Aricia, which seems to have been
Ι the turning-point in the war. How the war ended or
how long the Romans remained iu their abject con-
dition it is impossible to say, but it is clear that the
Etruscans were not able to establish themselves per-
manently on the left hand of the Tiber. Some twenty
years after this the Romans appear engaged in a ten
years’ war with Veii, in the course ofwhich the F abian
elan perished. This was terminated by a truce for
forty years (Livy 11. 54), by which apparently Rome
regained in relation to the Etruscans the same po-
sition she had held under the kings. By this time the
Etruscan power had begun to decline. The Gauls
were threatening them in the North, and at sea the
Sicilian Greeks, who began their victorious career by
the defeat of the Carthaginians on the same day on
which the battle of Salamis was fought, were robbing
them of their supremacy in the Tuscan waters‚ as later
on the Tarentines supplanted them in the Adriatic.
Under pressure of all these adverse forces the power
of Etruria. rapidly declined, and its ultimate subjection
to Rome became merely a question of time³. The
annalists represented the invasion of Porsinna as un-
dertaken for the purpose of restoring the Tarquins.
