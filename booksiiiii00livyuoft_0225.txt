NOTES. 11. c. xn. ἓ 14—0. 1111. 5 8. 193

From the use of the plural nmcti, the latter seems the more
probable. In that case, it is a constructio ad sensum, the case
required grammatically being attracted into the vocative bc-
cause of the vocative sense of the whole expression. Gomp.
Horace 11. Sat. vr. 20, seu Iane libentius audis.

§ 16. ceteri. ‘ The rest each in his turn as the lot brings
his name to the head oi the list will be here in due time, so
long as Fortune offers 8 chance of attacking you,’ or, ‘until
Fortune puts you in our power.'

pruni is prolepti03 ‘as the lot of each shall have fallen
’ (cado for the more usual excido) so that he comes first.’

c. xm. ς 2. quo (casu), prob. a modal abl. ‘in which.¹ If
the meaning were ‘ from which danger’ the prepn. a would be
required. Teqo, in the sense of ‘protocting,’ is not very common.

texisset. Subj. because the relative clause contains Pes
view of the fact.

ultro, ⁸ unasked.' Ultro is used of an action done proprio
motu, without any suggestion or impulse·from outside. Sponte
of an action done free1y‚ not under compulsion.

ἓ 3. iactatum de. On the analogy of aqi de, iactatum
being, as it were, a weak form of ac'tum, a mere hint or sugges·
tion, as opposed to a definite proposal.

quia, with indic. : a reason stated by Livy.

quod, with subi: a reason in the mind of Porsinna. ‘Not
because he had any doubt in his own mind that the Romans

ese e s.

ἓ 6. dux, ⁵ at the head of‚’ c. 1. 4.

ἕ 8. anas is not equivalent to ceteras. The use of it em-
phasizes the desire to regain Cloelia. Porsinna does not say
that he cared nothing for all the rest as a body considered nu-
merically, but for any except (different from) Cloelia.

facere=se facere. Orat. obliq. ‘he cared little (he said)
about any others!
