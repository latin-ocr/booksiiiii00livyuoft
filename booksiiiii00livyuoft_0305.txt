ἕ 5. quem, ἅο. The dependent interrogative sentence may
be regarded as an accus. of respect, ‘As to what prefaee,‘ ‘if
it be asked what, &c' Or, the whole sentence may be re-
garded as a sort of anacolouthon. Livy, instead of saying
non referam οι· something equivalent in the governing sen-
tence, changing the construction and writing forsan, dcc.

verum, predicate to the object aliquem (ειενιηοηιῑηι)ι may
have recorded some one speech (of the speeches recorded) a
true one, 'i. e. ‘may have given a true account somewhere in
the sp eeches recorded! Dionysius gives a full and circumstan-
, tial account of the speech, as if he had heard it himself. The
difference is instructive. Livy wished to bring the facts of -
their history, especially the facts of the noblest parts of it, as
well as he could before the minds of his countrymen. Dio-
nysius wished to show the Romam, how much a Greek could
teach them about their own history.

ἓ 5. Cloacinae. The name, like cloaca, is derived from
an old Latin word, cluerezpuryare. It is an epithet of
Venus, derived, according to Pliny, from the purifying of the
Romans with myrtle branches in the vicinity of her statue
after the rape of the Sabines. But it is more probable that
cloacina was an old Roman abstraction deity, afterwards iden-
tified for some unknown reason with Venus.

tabernas. The novae tabernae were on the N. side of the
Forum, the veteres on the S. In after times both were occupied
by bankers, and consequently frequently called Aryeutariae.

eaput, 11. 5. 7. Caput, as the seat of life, was used to
express the human being in the solemn formula of excom-
munication. Cf. consecratio capitia

sanguine. In allusion to the sacrifices with which the
comeo-ratio capitis was accompanied.

bl? 8. eamne, dcc. The indignant interrogative infin. in orat.
υ qua.

mammonam, lit. the terms or conditione on which a thing
is done; used here rhetorically to express the results that a

person has to look forward to in doing any action, ‘Was this
what they bore children for?⁷

cetera. Asyndeton.
