ἓ 5. consulares. Acc. after leuet-e (perf.). The subj. t
legere being prob. patres, understood. The choice and nomi-3
nation of the actual person lay with the consul. The qualifiae3
cation here stated as requisito for the dictatorship is out οὒ,
keeping with the fact that the dictatorship still existed during*
the period of the Tribuni militum consulari potestate, which}
lasted for a considerable time, and with the actual reeords ofr
the dictatore elected. Even in this case one tradition gave a}
non-consular as the first dictator. But Livy may mean that
there was a special regulation applying to this elcetiou on
account of the distrust of the consuls.

ς 6 magistrum. The original name of the dictator appears
to have been maqister populi. The dictatorship was a repro·
duction for a limited period in emergency of the irresponsible

ordinate magistrates to the dictator.

§ 8. dicto parere is practically one word, rather stronger

gliscens, ‘gathering strength) galisco is confined mostly
to poets and post-Augustam prose writers. It expresses rapid
and irresistible growth whether of a thing or a feeling, e.g.
gliscit iynis, multitudo. invidia. dcc. The derivation is uncertain.
The root is possibly the same as the Greek χλι- (in χλιαρός),
signifying originally warmth. In that case qli-sco would mean
