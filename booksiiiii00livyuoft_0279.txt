NOTES. III. c. xm. ἓ 8—c. xv, 5 7. 247

vadatus est. Vadam· reum is said of the plaintiff who holds
the defendant to bail.

ἕ 9. solum...causa. The regular phrase used of a man
who went into voluntary exile. The Roman law recognised the
right of an accused man to avoid trial by sels-expatriati0n‚ hence
nihilominus, διο. Probably Verginius argued that Caeso could
not become a citizen of Etruria and therefore was still a citizen
of Rome, for it was the law that a man who went into banish-
ment did not cease to be a citizen of Rome until he was ad-
mitted to the citizenship of another state.

c. xrv. 54. quum primo, ‘when for the first time after, &cst
ubl prunum, ‘as soon as even'
ut. c. 10. 6.

g 5. adesse. The regular word of supporting a man in a
law court as patron or advocatus.

ξ 6. nedum ut. Nedum is used adverbially, ut being con-
secutive with the same sense as above and c. 10. 6.

c. xv. ξ 3. interficiendorum. The gen. of the gerund after
consilium capere, inire is a classical construction.

ξ 4. et, ‘and so,‘ ‘ under these circumstances? introducing
the whole of the statements in two parts coupled by que,
‘accordingly while a war, δια, an evil nearer horne arose.'

sollemne. Annus prob. contains the root amb (am) which
appears in ἀμφὶ, ambire, dcc. sollus was an old Latin word
(Gk, ὅλος) which appears also in sollers, solidus, solliferreum
(sc. telum). Sollemnis therefore means recurring every year,
and secondarily that which ought to recur every year, stated,
regular. It was used specially in connexion with the regular,
stated festivals of the Roman religion, and hence is used by
Latin writers in two shades of meaning according as the re-
ligious connexion of the word, or the sense of regular recur-
rence, is predominant in the mind of the writer. Here it is
qualified by in singulos annos (showing that the dcrivation had
been lost sight of) and means ‘a regular annual institution!

ἓ 5. exules. Prob. men who had fled from Rome on ac-
count of debt. The patrician exiles can hardly be meant.

capitolium. n. 49. 7.

ἕ 7. sedando. 11. 9. 1, ‘by their very attempts to quiet
them.’ Lit. ‘in the process of.‘
