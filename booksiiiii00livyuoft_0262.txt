tributis. Up to this time, the tribunes had been elected
by the comitia curiata. See below ἓ 3.

ἓ 3. atroci, ‘alarming‚' atrox is connected with ater and
gets its secondary meaning by metaphor from that which is
‘dark, gloomy, threatening.'

sed quae, sed opp. to haud parva.

auferret, ἅτε. Mommsen's explanation of this passage and
c. 60. 4 is as follows: besides the patrician-plebeian comitia
curiata and tributa, there was a separate assembly of plebeians
in curies and tribes, not originally called comitia, but concilium
plebis curiatum and centuriatum, dating from the time when
they gained their separate officers. The tribunes were origi-
nally elected in the plebeian curiate assembly. In this, voting
being by heads and not according to lauded property, patricians‘
clients would have considerable influenee. Livy however con-
fuses these plebeian assemblies with the comitia curiata and
tributa! of the whole populus (patriciana and plebeians). Hence
he represents the patricians as excluded by the tribunes not
because they had no right to vote, but because they were there
for the purpose of obstruction, and further represents the
exclusion of patricians from the comitia tributa as dating from
this timo. The assembly according to M.’s theory, from which
the patricians were now, as they always had been excluded was
not the comitia tributa proper but the concilium plebis in tribes,
which afterwards carne to be called the comitia tributa. The
decrees of this plebeian assembly, he thinks, were from an early
time de sacto though not de jure binding on all the people‚
because of the powerful position of the tn'bunes, and in parti-
cular it assumed a criminal jurisdiction as the body before
{which the tribunes justified their acts. This jurisdiction he
calls, rather happily, an organised lynch·law (regulisirte Lynch-
justiz).

§4 actioni. Cf. 31. 8. The term was specially used of
the transactions in the comitia tributa.
