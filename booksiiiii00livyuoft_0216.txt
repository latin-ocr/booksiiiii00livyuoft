184 NOTES. II. c. vi. §7—0. vn. §2-

§7- Arruns, ἅο. ‘Arruns saw by the lictors in the dis-
tance that it was a consul approaching; presently, as he gained
a nearer and clearer view of the party, he recognised the form
and features of Brutus: then maddened‚’ dcc. Ex signifies the
source of intelligence, which is here the appearance of the lic-
tors. For the use of procul, cf. 64. 3. cognovit used in two
eonstmctions: (l) the accus. and infin.‚ consulem esse ; (2) the
accus. alone, Brutum. Lit. ‘when he perceived that the consul,
διο. (and) then nearer and more certainly by form also recog-
nised Brutus.'

ipse en. The natural position of en is first in the sentence
Its position here intensifies the force of ipse.

ξ 8. ψεεῐιιεὶριοἿ ‘rode strang-at)

ἓ 9. neuter. Each, in the desire to wound the other, taking
no care to protect himself.

memor. Cf. c. 2. 3.

infestis. Dr Donaldson would read infensis, maintaining
that infensus, only, signifies the feeling and infestus merely the
fact. But it is a question whether the distinction can be main—
tained without very arbitrary alteration of MS. readings. See
on c. 20. 2.

510. velut has a limiting force, ‘as if Mars was equa1‚’
meaning that neither side was very decidedly victorious, ‘They
fought with balanced success, the result being ahnost (something
like> a drawn battle.’

b ἲεηρὶζνεῐιίιωτ. This absolute use of this verb does not occur
e ore ivy.

c. vn. ἓ 1. omissa irrita re. For a similar combination os
words cf. 1. 14. 4, Immissa armata iuventute; vni. 12. 9, bello
infecto omisso. One of the participles is used adverbiassy as an
extension of the predicate contained in the other.

irrita. subjective. An enterprise from which they looked
for no results : so almost: ‘hopeless’

suas quisque. Ellipse of the special singular predicate, as
in Pictores et poetae suum quisquc opus ιι vulgo considerari vult
there is an ellipse of the general plural predicate. Both forms
are common in Livy. See Roby, Lat. (ir. § 1440. suas is pl.
on account of the collective sense of quisque.

Veiens. For this collective use of the singular in proper and
{lrssgesssional names see 20. 12 and Capes' Liq- Χῖα-ΗΠ. In-
Ῑ ἒ 2. Arsia. N.W. of Rome on the borders of Etruria and
,a ium.
