ς 3. ministeriaque, ‘whi1e,’ ἅτε. Colluvio...an9ebat and
ministeria...vul9abant are two parts of the description of the
aggravation of the disease intimately connected, of. 11. 12. 13.

ministeria 111 vicem and contaqio ipsa are distinct; attend-
ance on one another would of course spread the disease, but,
more than that, the merest contact, not amounting to attend-
ance on a sick person, did the same.

in vicem, cf. n. 64. 3.
ἓ 5. ut, i.e., ‘bidding the Hernicans to,' διο.

ἕ 7. infestus, n. 6. 8.
lapidem Gablna...via, cf. 11. 11. 7.

§8- in spe...tumu1tu‚ c. 11. 3. 2.

affecu, absolute. A technical uso of the word of people
labouring under a disease. Quite classical both in literal and
metaphorical sense.

aetas, abstr. for concrete, 11. 10. 8.

§ 9. per aetatem, ‘whose age and state of health would
allow of it.' For this use os per-:as far as concerns something,
compare the common phrase per me licet.

circumitio ac cum„ sc. viyiliarum.

summa rerum, summa in this phrase means the ‘ sum total’
or ‘ whole’ rather than ‘the highest point' (both being mean-
ings of the subst.), the whole of affairs devolving on a person
obviously meaning that he holds supreme control over all the
affairs of the state.

consula-ris. Livy can hardly mean that the superintendenee
of the watch was a duty of the consuls—in later times it was
certainly a duty of the inferior magistrates, Livy xxxu. 26. 17,
but rather that the Plebeian aediles were now responsible for
everything because they were the only magistrates left in the
city. On these magistrates see Mommsen 1. 280.

c. vn. ς 2. non modo...sed ne...qu1dem‚ 11. 61. 5.

avertere, whereas they might naturally have been supposed
to attraet them and would have done so, if they had had the
spirit of soldiers rather than plunderers.

§ 3. convellerent. The standards in camp were planted
in the ground. Hence the expression = ‘ to strike camp.'
