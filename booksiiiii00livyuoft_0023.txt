INTRODUGTION. Il. xix

entirely wanting in the advocate's speech. Livy then
had to mould the Roman prose speech to his purposcs.
He found in that speech dignity, purity, perspicuity,
and force. What it wanted for his purposes, was
greater elasticity and greater variety. To supply this
deficiency he not only availed himself of the unde-

Roman prose, but he took advantage of a tendency
perceptible in his predecessors, notably in Sallust, and
gaining ground in the every-day language of the time
in which he lived—the tendency to Graecise. The
meaning of the term Graecism as applied to a Roman
writer should be clearly understood. It is not to be
supposed that Livy3 or the poets of the Augustan age,
dragged into the Latin language Greek forms of ex-
pression, or Greek terms entirely alien to it, in the
wayin which the LXX. translatore dragged Hebrew
and other idioms into their Greek. What the former
did was to seize on those idioms of the Latin language
that assimilated to Greek, and produce or extend them
in the same direction, but that, with so much care and
skill, with such artful concealment, so to speak, of the
joints in the process, that the full Graecism appears as
the natural development of the rudimentary Latin
idiom. When Horace, for example, writes, Omne
cum Proteus pecus eyit allos visere wwmes, we feel
that it is a Graecism, but wc fec] also that the con-

the infinitive. WVhen, again, Livy uses sallo with a
participle, to express the same as λανθάνοι with a par-
ticiple in Greek, we see that hc is Graecising‚ but wc
