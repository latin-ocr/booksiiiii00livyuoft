INTROI) UCTIOA'. Ι. xiii

burgesscs were eutitled to enjoy the domam lau1‹l(nyar
publicus). F urther than this, the rent formerly paid
for the cattle grazing on the public pasturcs was
gradually allowed to fall into abeyance‚ while the
assignations of land to poorer burgesses and plolwians
were practically discontinued. Instead of this, tl1c
custom of occupation in heritable tcnancy of large

, portions of the aye?- publicus was introduced. The

poorer members of the community and, speaking
generally, the plebeiaus thus suffered loss in two ways.
They were not only deprived of a source of lix-elihood,
but they had to bear a· heavier burden of taxation, in
consequence of the cessation of income to the state
from the pastures. Under the pressure of these diffi-
culties, combined with the necessity of military service,
they fell into the power of the capitalists‚ from whom
they were obliged to borrow, and under the severe
Roman law of debt became in most cases slaves or at
least serfs of their creditors. In other worda the
farmer and yeoman classes of Rome were beginning to
be transformed into a class of villeins.

Under these circumstances, it is clear that the only
chance of salvation for the state lay in the plebeians
discovering in time their real power, and extorting
political recognition from the patricians. That power
lay in the simple fact that the patricians could not do
without them. They formed numerically far the largcr
portion of the community, and they furnished the bulk
of the Roman armies. The accounts of the annalists,
who dovetail together wars and agitations, are no doubt
imaginative in the extreme, but they are so sar true to
history that they record the consciousness of the people‚
