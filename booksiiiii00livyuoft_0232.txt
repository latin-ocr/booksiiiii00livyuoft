Livy's account represents these tribes as having been added to

rusticae would naturally increase in number as the territory was
extended by conquest. And it is borne out by the character of
the names of these tribes. Some of these bear the name of
ancient patrician qentes, whose separate local habitatione would
thus seem to have formed the tribus. The names of the others
are purely territorial. This would point to their addition at a
later time. Cf. c. 16. 5, and Seeley, Livy, Bk. 1. Introd.
