222 NOTES. Il. c. XLIV. ᾗ lO-c. XLV. ἓ 11.

5 10. qualicunque. This use of the indes. relative without
a verb, on the model of the Gk. ὁστισοῦν, διο. is exceedingly rare
in Cicero—(quivis is hardly in point)—but common in Livy.

sisti. c. 29. 8.

potuisse: because he is speaking of what was possible no
longer. The English idiom requires the past tense of the infin.,
so oportuit dicere, ‘he ought to have said;’ but oportuit dixisse,
‘he ought (at some time previous to the statement) to have
finished speaking;’ oportet dixisse, ‘he ought now to have
finished speaking ;’ oportet dicere, ‘he ought now to speak.'

non parendi, dcc„ ‘insubordinationff
§12. spes armaverant. c. 4. 3.

e.x1.v.§l. rem committerent eo, ‘to run the ¹³⁸‚k of fighting

Ι the loyalty)’ is really made by the context.

ἓ 5. indignatio versare. c. 4. 3.

non...non. Emphatic repetition of the negative instead of
conjunctione.

ἓ 7. capita conferunt. Not used elsewhere by Livy, but
used by Cic. Acad. 111. 12. 31.

semel with part. :ut semel with verb, ⁴ now that they were
once thoroughl)P roused)

ξ 10. quippe, not unlike enimvero, introduces a statement
the truth of which becomes obvious as soon as it is made; with
relative quia, q,uod &e it introduces an obvious reason.
qnippe is subjective rather than objectiva enimvero the reverse.

ἓ 11. sensim, ‘indi1e0t1y‚' feeling one' s way, as it were.
'in a transaction, by employing another person to act for one.
