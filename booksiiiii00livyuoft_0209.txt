Mommsen, R. Η. 1. 256 ff. The essential change, as Livy
points out, which converted tho Roman Govemment from a
Monarchy to a Commonwealth was not the abolition of the
royal powers, but rather the limitation of the reign of the

month at a time, performed the ordinary duties and assumed
the insignia of the office. Compare the expression, penes quem
fasces erant, 11. 8. 1. The reason given here is also given by
Cicero, l.c. But a more probable reason is the obvious incon-
venience of two supreme magistrates of concurrent powers
exercising those powers at the same time in the same city.
