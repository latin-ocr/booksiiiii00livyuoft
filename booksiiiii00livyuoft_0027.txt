INTHOD UGTJON. II. xxiii

The, adjective is separated from its substautivffi
(a) By words qualifying the latter. By this means
Livy to a certain extent supplies the want of the
article, which gives so much elastieity to Greek.
11. 32. ll,maturum covffecco cibo sanquinem ‚· 11. 49. 4,
Eyreqius quibuslibet temporibus semibus ³. On the same
principle the genitive is separated from the substan-

· ⁴tive it qualifieS. 11. 5. 2, Spem in perpetuum cum

iis pacis. (b) By words not forming part of the quali-
fication of the substantive3 111. 16. 4.

Great freedom is used in arrangement of words in
what are known as locutiones solemnes ,· e. g. Livy writes
pro vim'li parte (the usual order) or pro parte virili, at
will 3 he disregards the general rule of the position of
summus, primus, etc. e. g. luce prima, valle medid,
herein assimilating to poetic usage. On the other
hand, the preposing of the adjective is used for
grammatical purposes as above (a). Speeially Livian
also is the predicative use of the adjective so placed,
another reflexion of Greek elasticity, e. g. 1. 50. 3, Fero-
citer in absentem Tarquinium erat invectus, ἀπόντι
τῷ τ. πολὺς ἐνέκειτο (“ for being absent ”).

The supine in u is placed freely before and after
its adjective.

The verb inquit not unii-equently follows im-
mediately its subject.

Τὶιθ auxiliary and participle in compound tenses

⁸ This occurs in Cicero also, but to a much more limited
extent, being confined as a rule in ((ι) to a single cnse or its
equivfflcnt, a proposition and a substantive ; in ιΙι) to a single
substantive or particles.
