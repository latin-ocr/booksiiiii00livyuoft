5 10. vindicta. The manumissio per vindictam was a mode
of liberating a slave by a legal fiction. The master and slave
appeared before a magistrate, and a third person, previously
appointed, appeared to claim the slave. This assertor libertatis
laid a rod (vindicta festuca) on the head of the slave (the form
obser-ved in claiming disputed property) and pronounced the
words Hunc hominem liberum esse dico. Whereupon the owner
instead of disputing the claim turned the slave round, gave him

Α a tap on the cheek (alapa) and let him go, using the words

Hunc hominem liberum esse volo. The magistrate then pro·
nounced judgment in favour oi the claimant and so set the

5 2. semustum. The reading of the text is Madvig‘s, who
inserts ab se. Weissenb. reads se ortum, taking se to be abla-
tive, which seems very improbable; for the sense requires se in
the accus, and Livy would not use se as ablative without some-

thing (e.g. a preposition or word in agreement) to indicate the
case.
