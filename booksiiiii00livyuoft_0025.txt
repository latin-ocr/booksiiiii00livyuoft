INTRODUCTION. II. xxi

writing tell their own story. This use is limited to
those cases where the thoughts, feelingS, passions,
etc. of the people enter into the narrative, e. g. 11. ii. 3.
(2) The sudden transition in speeches from
oratio obliqua to oratio recta, and vice versit, 1. 13. 2 ;
11. 7. 9.
(3) Alternation of the periodic‚ and detached or

ι open styles, and variety in the lengths of periods.

Livy uses both the periodic and open styles in vivid
description (comp. 11. 6. 6—10‚ with 12. 7—14); the
former is of course more natural where a single or
single man's action is being described, the latter, where
the action is varied or the actors more numerous.
He also uses both long and short periods in quiet nar-
rative, the former where the action is more compli-
cated, especially by the addition of various motives.
Livy's longest period (xum. 18. 1-5) describes the
motives of Perseus in planning a campaign. A common
form of period in Livy is where a subordinate sentence
precedes the principal‚ itself being preceded by a pami-
cipial construction, xxm. 17. 1. But he exhibits great
versatility in his periods, both as regards the arrange-
ment of the subordinate clauses, and the variety of
the constructions used (e. g. 111. 57. 2—4).

Characteristic of his periods is a skilfuJ complica-
tion of participles in various constructions (cf. 111. 3. 6),
especially in the coupling of the absolute participle to
the participle in the construction of the sentence, and
to adjectives, 1. l. 4.

(4) The frequent use of parenthesis, to avoid
complication‚ especially to avoid the necessity for an
awkwnrd relative clause.
