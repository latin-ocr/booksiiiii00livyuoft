scribes the kind of trick‚ that is, the object or purpose of· it.
This use of the gen. gerund. with a subst. is found in Cicero
and Caesar. But Livy’s use is wider and looser than Cicero’s,
extending the use of the genitive.

nisi ita esset is part of the form which would be used in
the legal wager, used here to express the kind os process that
these people proposed to adopt. This was the sponsio. Tho
formal question put by the plaintifi (one of these multi) would
be si haec res ita est, or si in castr-is fuit Caeso, aeris ke.
(whatever tho sum might be) dare spondes ,² To which Volscius
would reply spondeo. This civil process would be preliminary
(praeiudicium) to the criminal. If Volscius gained a vex-dict
here, the case against him would be at an end. Livy, however,
is here transferring a legal process of later times to earlier.
