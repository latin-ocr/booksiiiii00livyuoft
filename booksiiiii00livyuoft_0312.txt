280 NOTES. III. c.1.v. ἐξ 5-8,

§ 5. noxae, partitive, lit. ‘pai-taking of the nature of
capital guilt.'

According to Cicero de Rep. 11. 31, the right of provocatio
was secured by the Twelve tables compluribus leyilms. This lex
of Livy’s, therefore, if it ever existed, must have been a single
and general expression and solemn ratifying of these enact-
ments. It is a question whether it applied to the dictator.
Dictators sine provocatione are mentioned afterwards. In vm.
33. 7, Fabius claims the right of provocatio against a dictator.
but whether by constitutional right or not, hardly appears.

iudicibus, decemviris. Cf. ἓ 11. Livy there rejects the
supposition that the consuls were included under iudicibus.
But he leaves us entirely in the dark as to what he understood
by the word himself. Under these circumstances it seems best
to understand it as in apposition to decemviris and as indicat-
ing the body of judicial assessors attached to the tribunate,
and known afterwards as Decemviri litibus iudicandis. Momm-

cereris. The name of this deity is Italian, the goddess of
the producing earth (cresco or creo). The cult of Ceres how-
ever, did not belong to the original Roman religion (her name
does not appear in the Arval cult). It seems probable that it
began with the introduction of the Asiatic Greek rites of the
Sibylh'ne books. The tried, Demeter, Dionysus, and Cora,
belonged originally to the district round Troy. Of these the
first was represented by the Italian name Ceres, the two latter
identified with the old Roman deities, Liber and Libera, per-
sonifications of natural processes. Ceres was especially a
goddess of the plebeians and the Ludi Cerei-is. a plebeian
festival. Hence, probably, her connexion with this law. The
temple stood at the foot of the Aventino, founded according
to tradition by the dictator A. Postumius in 13.c. 496 in accord-

aneg9with an injunctiou of the Sibylline books. Tac. Annal.

Liberaeque. These two deities are regarded as one in two
forms, therefore coupled by que to each other, and standing
together asyndeta in juxtaposition to Cereris.

ἓ 8. quum. Madvig's emendation for eum. With the
latter reading retained by Weissenb. id must be omitted.
Weissenb. encloses it in brackets.

The meaning of the passage appears to be that the lex did
