PREFACE.

THIS edition is intended mainly for the higher
classes iu schools. The text is Madvig's < Madvig
, and Ussing, 1873).

In the notes all that 1 have attempted is to
explain what appeared to require explanation, to
point out facts of Latin style in general, and Livian
style in particular, and here and there to translat-e.
In such translations as I have given, my aim has
been to excite in the minds of school-boys some
dissatisfaction with that comfortable jargon of con-
struing English, in the use of which they are still
so liberally encouraged by some editors of classical
authors. I have purposely avoided loading the
notes with etymologies, having found, as a matter
of experience, that such scattered etymologies are
of little practical use in teaching that elementary
portion of philology which is all that can be at-

tempted in schools
