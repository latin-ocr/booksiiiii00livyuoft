§ 6. auctor, of a man who proposes a law not originated
by himself. So 44. 1, 42. 8.

§ 7. is, nom. to contenderet only, placed here as frequently
to connect the sentence with the former.

ipse, as opposed to Volero, ‘on his side,’ ‘for his part.’

ἓ 9. quam, the corresponding tam is omitted, as frequently
in Livy. Cf. xxxv. 49. 7, homo uon quam isti sunt yloriosus.

5 10. templum, used in its wide sense of a place conse-

They ,might be regarded legally as mere representatives or
delegates οἱ the plebs, though οἰ course practically they were a
great deal more. It is this discrepancy between the ἱεραὶ and
