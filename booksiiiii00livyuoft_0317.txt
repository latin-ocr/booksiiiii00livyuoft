§ lO. nec omneS, &c.=quum nondum omnes educti essent
ii autem qui erant educti, ordines non satis explicassent.

explicatis ordinibus, predicate to qui erant. ‘Part of the
enemy's forces had issued from the gates, and the companies
one after another in regular order were marching down to their
respective places in the field when the consul, not waiting sor
them to mass in full force, advanced his line. He thus attacked
them before 811 their troops had marched out, and before
those, that had marched out, had formed open order. The
chaos of preparation was not over: men were still running
'about between the lines looking anxiously first at their own
ranks and then towards the rear, when the battle cry and the
charging 11188888 of the enemy cameto increase their agitation.'

Servare ordines may be said of soldiers on the march;
explicare ordines is said of soldiers opening out the close order
of marching for fighting purposes.

prope fluctuantem turbam, ‘almost a surging unorganized
111888,’ expresses the heaving agitated motion of a mass of
soldiers evolving into battle order.

se ac suos, *themselves and their own men,‘ expresses the
anxious look at the smallness of their present numbers and
eager desire to see the other troops advancing to their support.
