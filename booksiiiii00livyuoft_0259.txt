NOTE'S. ΙΙ. c. 1.. ἓ 8—0. mi. g 2. 227

ἓ 8. multiplicatis. ⁸ The ranks of the latter multiplying
as their circle was contracted‘ As the Etruscans closed iu,
narrowing their circle, the front of the lines was diminished,
and the number of them, one behind the other, consequently
increased. multiplicatis therefore is equivalent in sense to
densatis.

had been preparing to do, equally on all sides.‘ parem adverbial.
Intendere puynam is ‘to stretch out fighting in a certain ‹lirec-
ti0n‚‘ not nnlike our expression ‘to show fight.⁷

eo nisi. ‘Concentrating their attaek on that point.' So in
derectum niti. Nitor and its eompounds (eg. conitor) mean
‘to use all one's strength)

veiens. c. 20. 12.
