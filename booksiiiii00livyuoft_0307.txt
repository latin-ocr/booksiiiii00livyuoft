NOTES. III. c. L. ἓξ 1-16. 275

c. 12. 5 1. Vecilio, not known: prob. part of Algidus.
ἕ 3. et. ‘And moreover,' ‘then again:

54. ex. 11. 6. 2.

l ς 5. supinas, the attitude of prayer. Horace, Odes, 111. 23.

liberum. The generalizing plural heightens the pathos of
the expression.

ἓ 7. miae. It seems impossible to say whether this (as
· gloriae 11. 7) is gen. or dat. Madvig says that the former is the
usual constr„ but Cicero and Livy as well as other writers use
both cases. cf. 1. 34. 3, Filio superstes.

enim. The position is accounted for by the intimate con·
nexion of quoque with illis. Cf. 11. 18. 4.

g 8. documentum, a warning to guard against, &c. c. 24. 1.

5 9. vindicaturum, quite general sense. Livy seems to
have been a little overpowered by this word in this passage.

ξ 10. eadem lna, obj. after querendo docendoque, and sub-
ject to the subordinate interrogative clause quanto...viden·
which depends on docendo only.

oportuent. Madvig's emendation for MSS. potuerint, which
may however be defended by comparison with c. 34. 5.

profligatam lam rem. 'I'hat the decemvirate (government)
was as good as overthrown.

ξ 11. insecuti. Emendation of Gronovius tor insecutos.
This necessitates enclosing quum in brackets.

§12— massennes& 1.
§153 rat-pem, c. 31. Julius, e. 33. Sulpicius, c. 31. s.

qui, ‘what they meant by occupying,‘ dcc. Gk. οἵτινες, con-
ooete where we use abstract.

ξ 16. nullodum. This use of the enclitic dum after nullus
is only found in Livy.

offerre, infin. after nec-satis·audentib1ae=vix audentibus.
‘Not quite dai-ing) Otherwise, ut with subi. would be required.
Satis, as trequently in the comediam, expresses a reasonable or
average degree of the action implied in the word it qualifies,
rather than a degree sufficient for a special purpose. Compare
the interrogative use of Satin?

ut...m1tterent. Dependent imperative.
