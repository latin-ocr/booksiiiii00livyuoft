212 NO'I'ES. Il. c. xxxin. ἓ 4—c.xn1v. ἕ 3.

§ 4. ictum. Livy has also icit, icisse, and icturi foedus,
otherwise he uses serio. The phrase is said to be a ccm-
structio ad sensum, the striking of the victim implying the
conclusion of the treaty, and the verb being constructed ac-
cordingly. As regards the treaty cf. 41. 13 Mommsen, 1. 349.

t.§ 53 consilio, &c ‘Ready of resource, and prompt in
ac ion.

ἓ 6. forte in statione, ‘happened to be in command of
the outpost in that quarter.’ Cf. c. 10. 3.

ἕ 7. rettudit. Not common. xxxnr. 31. 8, Aetolorum lin-

quas retundere. Compare the use of ‘bang' in Shakespeare,
Othello, Act 11. Sc. i.

ignem. It is not absolutely patent from the narrative,
where he got the fire from.

ξ 8. ad terrorem, ‘ as the alarm spread' Cf. c. 8. 8.

utpote. With abl. abs. Not unfrequent in Livy. In
Cicero used only with relative or conjunctional clauses, ut—
pote qni, cum, ‹it-c. So Livy uses quippe, 111. 63. 2. Compare
the similar use of tanquam, velut, ut, dcc. The use is an
extension of Latin construction in the direction of Greek.

ἓ 9. foedus. This treaty is mentioned by Cicero (pro Balbo,
23) as extant in his time.

monumento esset. ‘ Had recorded the fact,' viz. that
Cominius had carried on a war with the Volsci.

ἓ ll. interpreti. Used in its simplest sense of a mediator.
Verg. Aen. 1v. 356, Interpres Divom.

arbitro, derived from cul and bit0=eo, means a person
who goes to something to sce or hear it, (1) as a witness3
(2) as commissioner to hear and decide a controversy, ‘ umpire.'

sumptus. Comp. 16. 7. This habitos dying without suf-
ficient property to pay funeral expenses appears to have been
almost de riyueur with the more conspicuous benefactore of
ancient Rome. It is the converse of the proverbial half-crown,
the basis of so much prosperous adventure in England.

sextantibus, prob. an anachronism, as coined money began
later than this in Rome.

c. xxx1v. ξ 2. qualis. ⁴ Equal to that of a besieged town!
§ 3. utique. c. 27. 7.
