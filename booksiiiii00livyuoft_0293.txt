g 4. rettulerat, ἀο. Omitted by Livy before. The account
of Dionysius is different. He represents that both consuls were
unwilling to propose the resolution: that they held the consular
elections as soon as possible, in order to shift the matter on to
' another year; that then Menenius fell ill, and Tertius endeavoured >
on that ground to put off the measure tiu next year, but was
forced by a combination of the consuls elect, and the tribunes,
to summon the senate and propose the bill.

ἕ 8. dommo d1e=decimo quoque. They took it in turn to ad·

praetectum luris. An expression not used elsewhere, but
evidently meant by Livy to express the decemvir whose day
of office it was. The account of Dionysius is clearer. He says
that each of the decemvir-s in turn represented the whole body,
as chief magistrate, assuming the insignia, summoning the
senate, &c., for a fixed term of days, whilst the others appeared
pretty much as private individuals ὀλίγῳ τινὶ διήλλαττον ὀφθῆναι
τῶν πολλῶν). But all administer justice.
