attested by a higher magistrate, though it was a violation of
this law to do 803 whereas a tribune, whose person was
inviolable by the oath sworn by the whole community after
the secession (11. 33, comp. 1v. 6. 7, quos (tribunos) foedere
icto cum plebe sacrosanctos accepISscnt), could not have hands
laid on him at all. In the one ease the higher magistrate took
⁴ the risk of prosecution under a law, in the other he ipso sacto
condemned himself of high-treason. Tho distinction is a fine
one, worthy of jurists.

plebeium magistrates were regarded as sacrosauet. Mommsen,
Staatsrecht, p. 73, n. 1.
