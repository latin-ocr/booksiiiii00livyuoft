234 NOTES. ΙΙ. c.1.1x. g ll—c.1.xl. ἓ 7.

decimus quisque. The verb decimo is not used till later,
e.g. Suetonius. The punishment was ancient enough. The
principle of it is thus stated by Cicero, pro Cluent. 46, Statue-
runt enim ita maiores nostri ut si a multis esset flagitium rei
militaris admissum sortitione in quosdam animadverteretur ut
metus videlicet ad omnes, poena ad paucos perveniret.

c. Lx. ξ 1. quo=ut consec. More usually quo with comp.
has a final sense. In this consecutive sense, it appears to be

only used after facio and compounds, xxm. 25. 8, quo maqis
laetarentur effecerat.

ἓ 2. concordiae, personification, cf. 4. 3.

populabundum, Livy has a great partiality for these adjec-
tives, comp. commis-sabaudus, concionabundus, deliberabundus,
errabundus, lacrimabundus, minitabundus, pereyrinabundus‚
tentabundus, venerabundus, cunctabundus, indignabundus, yratu-
labundas, mirabundus, ludibundus. The use of them before his

time is very limited. It may ahnost be said to have begun with
him as a literary prose usage.

ξ 3. placatior, other comparatives of adjectival passive
participles used by Livy are inclinatior (Cia), iynotior, celebra-
tior, excitatior, commotior, paratior, distinctior, cuneatior,
assuetior, obedientior, retractior, incautior, inflatior, impeditior,
confectior, honoratior, efferatior, impunitior, effrenatior, auctior.

ς 4. atroci, c. 56. 3.
ἓ 5. summovendis, c. 56. 4.

c. mn. ᾗ 2. tertio, for the more usual tertium.

ἓ 4. dumtaxat, concessive, ‘certainly' Not common in
Livy, and always after the word it qualifies. This is usually the
position of it in Cicero also, but not always, e.g. de Amic. c.
15. 53, Coluntur tamen simulatione dumtaxat ad tempus, where
dumtaxat qualifies ad tempus.

§5. non modo...sed ne...qu1dem. c. 23. 12.
aliquid, ‘somewhat.’ Not ‘in any respect,' which would
be quidquam. So in c. 2. 2, ne honos...uli11uid libertati...

officeret ist‘lest the honour should interime with liberty to some
senous ex en .’

§7- prodicerent, ‘adjourncd.’ In these earlier times the
trial would seem to have been eoneluded on the day on which
the accused man was summoned to appear. In later times.
the day of trial was fixed, generally by law, aster the nominis
receptio, that is aster the prcliminaries, including tho citatio,
had been completed.
