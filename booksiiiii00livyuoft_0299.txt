irae prob. means the decemvirs’ anger. They could not
see their way through (to) wrath or relenting; that is, they
could not see how far they could maintain their angry attitude,
or where they could begin to give way. But irae may possibly
. mean the people’s anger. They could see no measure of (that
is, no prospect of checking) the people'e wrath, and no measure
os giving way (that ie, where they could begin to give way).

modum, ‘limit‚' or ‘measure‘

praeiudicium means properly a legal decision which formed
the basis of further proceedings, such as is the decision of a
coroner's inquest in England. It is used sometimes also more
generally of a decision which forms a precedent for other cases.
Livy here seems to combine the two meanings in this secondary
use of it. L. Cornelius deprecated the passing of any resolution
which would hsmper or effect in any way the final decision of
this important question, either by fixing the form it was to

ς 12. decemvir. Decemvirum (gen. pL), for which there is
