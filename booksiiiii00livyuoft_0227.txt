NOTES. ΙΙ. c. xv. g l—c. xvi. g 5. 195

c. κν. 5 2. non quin. ‘ Not that...not,⁷ negative ot ‘ non
quo’ with subj. : a classical usage expressing a desire to antici—
pate and deny a reason that might be suggested for a previously
stated fact. The English vulgarism ‘not as how' is a near
equivalent. Cic. de Orat. 11. 72, Non tam ut prosim causis
elaborare soleo quam ut ne quid obsim: mm quin enitendum sit
in utroque, sed tamen, &c.

non rempl reges. ‘ That there was no restoring the kings!
The present instead of the future emphasizes the certainty
of refusal. Cf. v. 20. 1, Dictator cum iam in manibus videret

. victoriam, urbem opulentissimam capi, ἁο.

ln pemmoni. In signifies the tendency or natural end of
a course of action. Livy, as other post-Ciceronian writers,
also uses it to express the actual result of an action. Comp.
accendere in puynam with exardescere in contentionem. This
usage is probably due to the influence of Greek.

’ἓ 3. in animum and animum inducere admits of the infin.
or ut with subj. after it. The latter is more usual.

erit, vivid use of indic. ior subj. Strictly speaking, the
indic. in orat. obliq. should introduce the writer's own state-
ment. A Graeciam. Cf. xxv. 4, 6.

§ 5. obstinatum. A very rare use of the word. which is
commonly used only of persons or human faculties, e.g. am·-
mue. destinatum is more commonly used in this sense.

obtundam, used absolutely, eadem being governed by ayendO.
So Ter. And. 348, obtundis tametsi intellego.² In Cic. Verr. iv.
49 it is a question whether the words aures vestras ought not
to be supplied.

The origin of the absolute use is prob. an ellipse of aures.
Hence the verb gets the sense of wearying persistence generally.

’,Ι will not go on with wearisome persistency driving conti-¹·
nually at the same point to no purpose.' ¹

c. xvr. §2- Tusculo. Comp. c. 15. 7.

5 5. vetus, ἁο. ‘All who came (to Rome for the comi-
tia, ἀο.) from this district (that in which the Claudii were
settled) were known as the old Claudian tribe, when subse·
quently new §laudii were added to the communius) The
opposition between vetus and novis seems to point to this as
ιὶἐθ natural translation oi this passage, which is however very
ο scure.

The oldest tribus rusticae were named from the elan dis-
tricts (pagi). Mommsen, R. H.. vol. 1. pp. 39, 46. See also
c. 21. 7.
