sentence, the criminal was executed, under the superintendenoe
of the tribunes, by being thrown from the Tarpeian rock (v1.

The principal leges sacratae of historical times were those
mentioned here and those which secured the inviolability of the
Tribunos. Comp. 111. 55.

ἓ 3. subrogando. Roqare in such compounds as this is
used in the technical sense of submitting 8. proposal to the
comitia, the nature of the Proposal being indicated by ‘the

, preposition. Thus subroflare is to make 8, proposal for filling

8, vacant office, proroyare to propose an extension of office, dcc.
Praetically the words are used not simply of the proposal made
but of the act of the comicia assenting to the proposal. Not
unfrequently they are used in a general sense, e.g. erogare, to
pay or spend.

ξ 4. mag-no natu, a case of hypallage and condensed
expression. Livy applics maynus to the man's birth, whereas
it properly belongs to the man, who is great in respect of the
time of his birth, mayno natu=cum orandis natu esset. Cf.
111. 38. 1, v. 3-1. 3.

§ 5. memoriam. Cf. e. 4. 2, Memoria abiit. The use of
intercidere in this connexion is rare, and memoria is more

commonly in the abl. in such expressions than subj. to the
verb. Cf. c. 33. 9.

incutiunt. In Latin a messenger is identified with his
message. Hence nuntius practically means both 8 messenger
and 8 message. Livy here, by way of coining 8 telling ex-
pression, speaks of striking 8 message into the consul, suggest-
ing the sudden terror caused by the message. Cf. incutere
tirggrem,vffc.‚ ‘sought to shake him from his purpose by
su en e news!

cums auce.

g 8. non simply negatives crediderit. The omission of
utrum or ne in the first clause of a double sentence is common.
‘W'hether he was incredulous or too strong-minded to care;'
‘He may have been incredulous: he may have been very
strong-minded: tradition leaves the question open, and it is
not an easy one to settle now.'
