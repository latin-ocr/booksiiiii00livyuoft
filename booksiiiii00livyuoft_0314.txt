quibus. The construction is rather irregular, the ablative
quibus referring to the same thing as the objective genitive
earum. This repetition, where the subject of the ablativo
absolute is either the subject or the obJ'ect, or reappears in
some subordinate relation in the principal sentence, is not
unfrequent, and, as in repetition generally, the obJect is dis-
tinctness and emphasis. It is not a construction that young
Latinists should imitate, because they are almost certain to
imitate it perversely.

Cf. Cic. in Pis. ξ 23, Quae ornamenta etiam in Sex. Claudio
te consule voluisti. Horace, A. P. 173, Laudator temporis acti
se puero. Livy, xxxvm. 7, Paucis...elapsis eoram absentium
direptae fortunae.

ς 10. bona. malaque, ‘services and faults.‘ Cf. Sallust,
Jug. 73, In utroque mayis studia partium, quam bona aut mala
sua moder-abant.

experturum...exper1r1, frequently used of trial in a law
court. Cic. pro Quint„ c. 23, Eyo experiri non potui. In this
passage it is used in two slightly different shades of meaning;
⁴ To test the value of his merits,' dac. and ‘ To take his trial at
the tribunal oi the Roman people‚‘ lit. ‘to try, risk‚ or, take his
chance of the judgment‚' dcc.

ς 12. tollendae qualifies foedere, and signifies the object

at, like ἀλλά, emphasizing an opposition between the apo·
dosis and protasis of a conditional or concessive sentence, in
Cicero only used when the protasis is negative, e. g. si non
hominis, αε humanitatis rationem haberet, pro Quint. 31, comp.
c. 17. In Livy, after a conditional protasis, a personal pro-
noun follows ᾳτ.

domicilium, which he had been in the habit of calling the
plebeian's home. The expression was perhaps suggested by
Cic. in Vorr. 11. 5. 55, Carcer illc qui es! a crudelissimo tyranno

lium civium Romanorum suit.
