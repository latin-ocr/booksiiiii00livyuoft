ἓ 5. pontifex. Asconius on Cic. pro Balbo c. 24 says,
Decem tribunos pl. per pontificem. quod magistratus nullus erat,
creaverunt. Τὴε tradition. if true, points to a special form of
election, legalised for a special emergency. The connexion of
the pontifex with it is probably due to the lex sacrata by which
the position of the tribunes was originally established.

, ’ congratulantur. Sc. inter se. The word is raro. The par-
ticipial construction after yratulor, expressing the subject sor
conmtulation, is common.

§8- Quod bonum, faustum, διο. Cf. 11. 49. 8.

§15- consulibus. The tradition that Livy follows represents
this assembly (the comitia tributa, cf. concilium plebis.- see 11.
56. 4) presided over by the patrician pontifex, as re-establishing
not only the tribunate, but the consular authority. But the
account is very improbable. No such royano as that men-
tioned here was required. After the fall of the decemvir an
inter-rex appointed in the ordinary way would appoint another
interrex who would hold the consular comitia.

Haminfls, named after C. Flaminius Nepos, who was killed
at the Trasimenus. As censor he constructed the circus and
the road also named after him, ac. 220. The district (also
called Circus ΕΙ.) formed the southern portion of the Campus
Martius, between the Via Lata and the river.

'to enact a law which cannot be interfered with, without
violating the religious feeling of the community and inem-ring
corresponding penalties‚’ so ⁸ to solemnly enaet‚’ ‘to fix by an
ordinance for ever.’ The main fact connoted is the unalter-
able nature of the enactment, established by the penalties
attached. Comp. 11. 8. 2.
