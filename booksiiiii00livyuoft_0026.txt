xxii INTROD UOTJON. II.

(5) Asyndetism, chiasmus anaphora, and iteration.
These figures are of course common to Livy with other
writers, but he uses them very frequently, and with
great skill. Chiasmus is employed in the members of
a period, and in the members of a sentence: 11. 40. 3,
44. 2. One noticeable form of anaphora is the repetition
of a predicate in the form of a participle at the be-
ginning of a fresh sentence, to mark the immediate
sequence of action3 11. 25. 5.

(6) F orms of sentence evidently modclled on
Greek (a) interrogative, in participia] and conjunctional
clauses 3 Quid Alpes aliud credentes quam montium
altitudines ,· Quid ut a vobis sperent? Comp. also
111. 72. 3, quo cum dolore Itos, quo cum qaudio illos,
where audituros must be supplied from the previous
audire. (b) Objective, in which the subject of the sub-
ordinate is made the object of the principal sentence ;
Hic ‘metus Codrionem...oppidum ut dederetur Romanis

effecit ?

(7) Peculiarities in arrangement of individua]
members of the sentence :

The subject of a subordinate sentence preceding
the principal, not being also subject to the principal,
is nevertheless placed before the conjunction of the
subordinate, 11. 28. 5. The subject of a sentence
is placed inside an ablative absoluto3 Cum clausis
Audrartodorus Insalae portis, etc. The coqnomen is
proposed to the nomen, and the latter separated from
the proenomen; e. g. Ahala Servilius, Marcus erat
macarius, etc. The object in dependent interrogative
is placed before the interrogative word; 111. 13. 7.
