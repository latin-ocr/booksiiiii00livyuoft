262 NOTES. III. c. xxxlv. ἓ 2—c. xxxv. ξ 6.

§ 2. quod bonum, διο. 0. 26. 9.

ἓ 4. quid, oze. ‘Point out in the interest of all, any faults
of excess or defeet in the several articles.’ In medium, the
prominent notion of this, in the various phrases into which it
enters, is that of publicity‚ but conferre here adds the implica-
tion oi general advantage. So consulere in medium.

iussisse. ‘ Passed.' The people being thus invited to criti-

eise the laws before they became law, might be said to propose as
well as pass them.

posset. c. 50. 10.

ξ 6. ad, ‘in accordance with,’ ‘by‚' qualifies correctae, so
ad nutum, voluntatem, &a

ἓ 7. velut. 11. 6. 10.

36 §6 8. appellatione. Modal abl. For the fact comp. e.

c. xxxv. ἓ 1. trinum. Three market-days (=n0t less than
seventeen days) was the ordinary notice required in publio
matters, e.g. the promulgation of a bill was for three nundinae.

ἓ 3. dimissa. ‘The possibility of being unseated.‘ Lit.
‘His position being now sent forth into danger!

ea aetate. Abl. of circumstance. Here almost :pro ea, dcc.
‘ Considering his age and the offiees he had held! ‘ At his age,
and after the offices,‘ dcc. That is, his youth and decemvirate.
But Livy has pretty evidently misunderstood his authorities.
He represents this Appius Claudius as the son of the Appius
Claudius of 11. 56, ὥσ. (see ἐξ 7 and 9, patruo, &e.)‚ but at the
same time in c. 33. 7 speaks of his change of feeling towards the
plebs, whereas the younger man could not have been notorious
at that time as an enemy of the plebs. And here the language
is much more applicable to the elder Appius. Probably Livy's
authorities in both places were speaking of the elder man, and he
understood what they said of the younger. It is curious that
in a fragment of the Capitoline Fasti the decemvir is represented
to be the Appius Claudius whom Livy represents as the father
of the decemvir.

ξ 4. propior. 11. 64. 6. For the comparison of a person
with an action, 11. 13. 8, supra Coclites. Sco. id facinus esse.
